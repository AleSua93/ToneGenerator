# Tone Generator

Pure tone signal generator for android devices. 

## Getting Started

* You need to have Android SDK and Android Studio installed.
* Run the app using Android Studio or deploy the apk. to your device of choice.

The frequency can be changed by either adjusting the slider or by using the textbox (it only accepts
integers).

As of now, the only available waveform is a sine wave.

### Prerequisites

* Android Minimun SDK: 5.0 (Lollipop)

## Info on wave synthesis

Three types of waves are generated: sine waves, square waves, and sawtooth waves.

Sine waves are the most basic type. The equation that defines their behaviour
is as follows:
