# Tone Generator

Pure tone generator for android devices. 

## Getting Started

* You need to have Android SDK and Android Studio installed.
* Run the app using Android Studio or deploy the apk. to your device of choice.

The frequency can be changed by either adjusting the slider or by using the textbox (it only accepts
integers). Bear in mind that most phone speakers can't reliably reproduce lower frequencies (below 200 Hz 
approximately) and human hearing usually rolls off at around 18kHz, so if you're not hearing anything
it might be because of one of those reasons.

### Prerequisites

* Android Minimun SDK: 5.0 (Lollipop)
